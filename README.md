# Hi, I'm Bruno 👋🏻🧑🏻‍💻

Over the past years, I have been working as fullstack engineer on numerous projects, programming and testing across a variety of platforms and languages. I have BSc degree in Computer Science from the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) in Brazil and Data Science Specialization from the Johns Hopkins University. I have participated of some programming competitions, the last one involved to identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee using deep learning algorithms for image classification. My research interests lies in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, using computer science and statistics as tools to understand life and its numerous aspects. In my free time, I like to read, enjoy a cup of coffee, write my blog or philosophize on various aspects of life and cultures.
